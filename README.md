This repository contains my coursework assignments for the CSE 5334 Data Mining course, part of my Master of Science in Computer Science program. This repository contains a collection of assignments demonstrating various concepts and techniques in Data Mining.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment from the Data Mining course. The contents include source code, outputs, and documentation for each task.

## Assignments Overview

### Programming Assignment 1:

-   **Focus**: tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, TF, DF, IDF, TF-IDF, cosine similarity
-   **Description**: Implementation of code that processes a text corpus to perform text analysis and information retrieval tasks.

### Programming Assignment 2:

- 	**Focus**: Data preprocessing, feature selection, classification, model evaluation.
-	**Description**: This assignment focuses on applying data mining techniques to a dataset to analyze NBA player statistics and predict player roles. Key components include:
	-	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing datasets, and preparing data for analysis.
	-	Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features based on statistical analysis for use in modeling.
	-	Classification: Select the best classification models to accurately predict player positions. Models compared were: SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
	-	Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and correlation matrix to identify which classes the model had issues classifying correctly.
	-	10-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation techniques to assess the robustness of the models across different subsets of the dataset, ensuring that the results are generalizable.
